# hello-world
My very first GIT repository. Woop!
Good morning, I am taking care of my kids today.  They made cookies with "Aunt Jean", the nice older lady who lives down the hall.
I decided to put some of this time to work, so signed up for my first GITHUB account or repository as I now know it is called.
The kids are watching my little pony on netflix.
Etta is sitting and playing games on the fire tablet.
Marian is sitting on the couch watching the cartoon.
I am sitting at my makeshift desk in the living room.  My brand new color laser printer is in a box behind me. Later today I will start drawing components and plans for the LIDAR scanner. Hydra? The "Lycia"?  we'll see.
